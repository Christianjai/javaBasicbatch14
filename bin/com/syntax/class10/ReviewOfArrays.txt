Arrays:
	Arrays are consecutive memory locations which store
	same type of data.

Why we need arrays?
	Arrays help us store large amounts of data in a single variable
	For example if we want to store the names of 100 students, we dont
	need to create 100 variables, we can simple create and array
	of size 100 and it will store the names.

Syntax(how to use):
	dataType[] name of array=new dataType[size]
	dataType[] name of array=new dataType[]{store the elements}
	For example and int array that stores three numbers
	int[] arr=new[]{10,20,3};
