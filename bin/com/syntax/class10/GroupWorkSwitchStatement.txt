Switch statement

SWITCH CASE - the switch statement tests the equality of a variable against multiple values.
IT IS similar to if else if conditions,Its much cleaner code, its my preferred code, its faster than the if conditions
because  switch expression is evaluated once.
A switch works with the byte, short, integer, char and String.
LIMITATIONS for switch case are:
	for data types: double,float,long & boolean
	and for operators: logical and relational



The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
The switch statement can have a number of possible execution paths.

For example:
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

-The value for a case must be of the same data type as the variable in the switch. ( so if switch is integer data type, case must be also integer)
-Duplicate case values are not allowed in switch statement.
-The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.
-The default statement is also used in switch cases, it is optional and can appear anywhere inside the switch block, but usually it's placed at the end
 and preferably used with the break statement aswell.
-In case, if it is not at the end, then a break statement _must be kept_ after the default statement to omit the execution of the next case statement.
