Type casting:
	Type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another.
		We have two types of type casting=
		1) Explicit/narrowing/manual
		2) Implicit/widening/automatic
		When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called explicit/narrowing/manual.
		When we go from smaller data type to a larger data type we call it implicit/widening/automatic.
	
	Smallest to biggest:
		1) byte (8)
		2) short (16)
		3) int (32)
		4) long (64)
		5) float (32)
		6) double (64)
	
	Why we need type casting?
		When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types. When we are working
		with math sometimes we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only interested in the non decimal part.
	
	What is the syntax?
	
	1) Explicit/narrowing/manual
	
	int box=1000;
	byte box2=(byte) box;
	
	2) Implicit/widening/automatic
	
	short box1=250;
	int box2=box1;

If statement:
	If else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based on some condition and provided
	data.
	if condition
	if else condition
	if else if condition
	nested if else condition.
	
Why we should learn about if else condition?
	when we are solving real life problems like testing a web site our program needs to make a lot of decisions.

What is the syntax of if else conditions?
	if conditions	
	
	boolean rich=true;
	if(rich) {
	System.out.println("Lets buy a Jet, Island");
	}
