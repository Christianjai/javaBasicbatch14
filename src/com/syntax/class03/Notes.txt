Type Casting (primitives);
	-type casting is converting one data type to another one.
	-for example we can convert a short to -> byte, long -> float, etc.
	-There are 2 main types: implicit/widening/automatic & explicit/narrowing/manual
	
Implicit/widening/automatic Type casting;
	-When java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happens when we assign a smaller 
	data type to a larger data type, because there is no data loss in this conversion.

Explicit/narrowing/manual Type casting;
	-When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called explicit/narrowing/manual.
	It does not happen automatically, we have to do it _MANUALLY_.

Why we should learn type casting;
	-When we write code in our real life, most of the time we use the code from others to save time and
	we might also need to convert the data types to make our code compatible with their code.

What is the syntax for type casting;
	-We use () and inside the () we write the destination data type, for example if we want to convert
	a long to an int this is how we do it:
	
	explicit
	long box1=250;
	int box2=(int)box1; //its explicit/narrowing/manual
	
	implicit
	double box3=box2 //its implicit/widening/automatic
	
	float f=250.5f;
	double d=f; //its implicit/widening/automatic (no need to set () inside)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If else conditions:
	If else condition help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
	
Why we should learn If else:
	Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website our programs need to make
	a lot of decisions. 
	
	example
	If (the given user name and password matches) {go to home page} else {give user a warning}

What is the syntax for if else conditions:
	Inside () <- always put conditions
	
	boolean isHungry=true;
	
	if (isHungry) {
		System.out.println("im hungry");
	} else {
		System.out.println("lets build some java programs");
	}
