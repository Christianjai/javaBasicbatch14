Classes and Objects?
	A class is a template/blueprint from which we create the objects.
	An Object is programming is very similar to the objects that we have in real life.
Object:
	Objects have states that defines how the object looks like. we define the states with the help of
	Attributes/properties/fields inside a class.
	Objects can also have behaviours(Things that object can do). We use methods to define these
	behaviours.
